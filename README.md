# search-and-destroy
This program will search for and destroy certain programs that you can define in the Sad.cpp file. 
If you choose to build from source, do so with C++ 17 on Visual Studio 2019. Requires libcurl (easiest to install with [vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=msvc-160 "vcpkg documentation") on Windows).
